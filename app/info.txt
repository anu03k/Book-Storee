The includes method is a built-in method in JavaScript that is used to check whether a string contains 
another substring or whether an array includes a specific value. It returns true if the specified value is
 found, and false otherwise.

 /* A callback function is a function that is passed to another function as an argument 
and is called back by the other function when it is finished executing. Callback functions are commonly 
used in asynchronous programming, where one function needs to wait for
 another function to finish executing before continuing. */


// The map function in JavaScript is a higher-order function that takes an array as input and returns a new array with the results of calling a function on each element of the original array.
/*Optional chaining is a JavaScript operator that allows you 
to access nested object properties without having to c
heck if each intermediate property exists. This can be useful for avoiding errors and making
 your code more concise. 
 

 JSX elements directly inside a map() call always need keys!
